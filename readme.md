## CSE5IDP K9 Deli appointment booking system

Test commit by Svasti

This is a flask based system to allow the employees of the K9 Deli to automate their booking system.
it is inspired by a system created by a previous latrobe group working with K9 Deli

This system is intended to allow customers to easily book their own appointments then confirm them via a text message sent using Twilio SMS.
this message will allow customers to confirm or cancel their appointments while also reminding them. however rescheduling will instead be done via phone calls.
