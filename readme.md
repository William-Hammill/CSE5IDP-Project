## CSE5IDP appointment booking system


This is a flask based system to allow the employees of a pet grooming business to automate their booking system.

This system is intended to allow customers to easily book their own appointments then confirm them via a text message sent using Twilio SMS.
this message will allow customers to confirm or cancel their appointments while also reminding them. however rescheduling will instead be done via phone calls.
